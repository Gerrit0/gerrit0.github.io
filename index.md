# Hello, I'm Gerrit

I am a student at The University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and am an avid programmer.

Over the past two summers I have worked as an intern at [Northrop Grumman](http://www.northropgrumman.com/) and am looking forward to returning next summer. During breaks, I usually work on learning a new language, or taking on a new programming challenge.

### Languages

- TypeScript / JavaScript
- HTML / CSS / SASS
- C#
- Java
- PHP / MySQL
- Visual Basic


### Projects

- [image-overlay-tool](https://gerritbirkeland.com/image-overlay-tool) - a tool to quickly overlay an image on top of another image.
- [tools](https://gerritbirkeland.com/tools) - a collection of scripts to make my life easier
