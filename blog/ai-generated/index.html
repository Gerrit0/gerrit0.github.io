<p class="subtitle">2025-09-27</p>

<p>I have been maintaining open source projects for more than a decade at this point
and have recently started noticing that some people who interact with my
projects (especially for the first time) are sending text which is generated
largely or even completely by an AI. If you are reading this, chances are
you were sent a link to this page as a part of a terse response to something
you pushed to me.</p>
<p>As a maintainer, I think it is great that LLMs have made it easier for many
people to try new things or quickly get a handle on new projects. This includes
both if your experience doesn't cover writing code at all or just doesn't involve
directly working on <em>this</em> project.</p>
<p>However, all of our time is limited and everyone has to be selective
about what they decide to spend their time doing. Open Source maintainers
frequently dedicate an inordinate amount of time to making their projects
better, solving bugs and implementing features requested by their users.
Many of us do this purely out of an enjoyment of helping people and it makes
our day or even our week to solve some stranger on the internet's problem.</p>
<p>Anything which kills that joy must be avoided. If maintaining a project turns
from a fun side project into a painful drudge, I <em>will</em> stop doing it.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed by now, being sent large amounts of AI generated
text that I have to slog through in order to uncover the actual need of the
human behind it fits exactly into the type of drudgery that will lead to the
decision that it isn't worth my time to interact with it.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of reasons for this, but in the interest
of respecting your time I'll limit this post to what I am asking of you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If making a bug/feature request, explain <em>your</em> problem.</strong><br>
LLMs can probably come up with a dozen adjacent features and explanations
to make them sound critical, but as a human in the business of building
things for humans, I'm interested in hearing what you want, not what some
obfuscating LLM interpreted the original request as.</li>
<li><strong>If making a pull request, make sure that you understand everything it contains.</strong><br>
Before I merge anything, I make sure to read through it and understand what
it does and why. A LLM might be able to help you more quickly come up with
a solution, and if it does, great! However, you, the human, needs to understand
why what you are submitting works and why each portion of it is necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>AI output tends to include a ridiculously large amount of noise for any useful information
produced. You are welcome to use AI to assist in contributing to any of my projects, but if
you do, I expect <em>you</em> to do the work to distill that output down into something a human
would actually write. I will not do that work for you, and will ignore/close any submission
which attempts to foist that work onto me.</p>
